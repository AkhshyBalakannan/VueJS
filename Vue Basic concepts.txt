VUE JS

Vue Js is an JavaScript Frontend framework model-view-viewmodel
    Vue works on the JS and HTML page 

Its used to declare things from the JS to the HTML directly using {{ }}

To start using the VueJS we need to install the vue using the npm or we can use the
CDN with the version and add it to the end of the body and before the custom script scr 
After this we are good to go...

Normally to create a VUE app we need to write in the JS file
Declarative Rendering
for example:
    index.html:
        <header>...</header>
        <body>
            <div id="app">
            {{ message }}
            </div>
        </body>
    
    main.js:
        var app = new Vue({
            el : '#app'     // This is the linking of the vueJS and the html with ID attr
            
            // All the datas are send as object from here and so we create an object data 
            
            data : {
                message: 'Hello Message'
            }
        })


v-bind 
        Basic working is alternative of {{ image }} in src, etc.,
    which will create bond between data and the attribute that is to be changes
    Dynamically binds an attribute to an expression
    
         
    we also have a shorthand like v-bind:src as :src
        :alt="description"
        :href="url"
        :title="tooltip"
        :class="isActive"
        :style="isStyled"
        :disable="isDisabled"      // we also have the ! not equalto operations.

    index.html:
        <header>...</header>
        <body>
            <div id="app">
            {{ productName }}
            <img v-bind:src='image' alt="product-image"> // which will be like src={{ image }}
                    // the above line is rewritten as //
            <img :src='image' alt="product-image"> // which will be like src={{ image }}
            </div>
        </body>

    main.js:
        data : {
                image : './assests/images/xyz.jpeg'
        } 


Directives:
    this is normally prefixed with the v- Reactive behaviour rendered by vue 
    these comes from the data object

    conditionals in Vue
        <span v-if="seen">You see me when true</span>
        <span v-else="seen">You see me when false</span>

        data : {
                seen: true
            }

    We also have calculation like
        <span v-if="inStock" > Stock available </span>
        <span v-if="leftOut < 10 && leftOut > 0"> Few products left </span>
        <span v-else> Sold out </span>

        data : {
                inStock: true
                leftOut: 100
            }


        This if statement are like DOM manipulating stuff and so things which are freq change we need to use v-show
        <span v-show="inStock" > Stock available </span>
        
            The main difference between show and if statement is the show will just use the inline css 
            display = None, where as the if statement will completely remove it from the DOM

    listing directives:
        this is used for "for"

            Simply its as same as the condition loop using the v- prefix with "for"

            index.html:
            <ul>
            <li v-for="detail in details">{{ detail }}</li>
            </ul> 
            <div v-for="variant in variants" :key="variant.variantId"> // usual we need have key so that vue can keep tack of variantId
                {{ variant.variantColor }}  // Here we can access the data using the dot notation
            </div>

            main.js:
            
                data : {
                    details: ['detail1', 'detail2', 'detail3'],
                    variants: [
                        {
                            variantId: 1,
                            variantColor: "blue"
                        },
                        {
                            variantId: 2,
                            variantColor: "red"
                        }
                    ]
                }


    Event Listener: v-on || @
        normally in Js we have the event listen which gets triggered when something happens and same here
    
        v-on:click="doSomething"

        the v-on will be the event listener here which gets triggered when something happens

        index.html:
            <button v-on:click="cart += 1"> Add to the cart </button>

        main.js:
            data: {
                cart: 0,
            }

// the above Event listener example is pretty simple and fairly be complex when we have a lot of functions running in realtime
// so we are gonna write separate functions and call them

         index.html:
            <img :src="image">
            <div v-for="variant in variants" :key="variant.variantId"> 
                <p @mouseover="updateProductImage(variant.variantImage)"> // here we use the @ as v-on Event listener 
                    {{ variant.variantColor }}
                </p>
            </div>

            <button v-on:click="addToCart"> Add to the cart </button>

            
        main.js:
            data: {
                image: './assests/image/xyz.jpeg'
                variants: [
                        {
                            variantId: 1,
                            variantColor: "blue",
                            image:'./assests/image/blue.jpeg'
                        },
                        {
                            variantId: 2,
                            variantColor: "red"
                            image:'./assests/image/red.jpeg'
                        }
                    ]
                cart: 0,
            },
            method:{
                addToCart: function() { // this also can be written as addToCart() { this.cart += 1 } ES extra-hand
                    this.cart += 1      // "this" keyword is used for mapping value inside the data object
                },
                updateProductImage(variantImage) {
                    this.image = variantImage
                }
            }

        We also have other event listener written as 
            @click  @mouseover  @submit    @keyup.enter // .enter is an modifer which does the function once enter is keyupped



Class & Style Binding
        Explanation is as same as the title itself you can change the style using v-bind:style or :style 

        We also can use the conditionals statement [isActive ? activeClass : '']
                                                    true         active
   
    class Binding:
        <button v-on:click="addToCart"
                :disabled="!inStock"
                :class="{ disabledButton: !inStock }">Add to cart</button> 

// here the class attr is binded with the instock object value and which is used with ! 
// if the the inStock is false it will return true and which will add the class name disabledButton

we can Dynamically add a class name with its value in the data object from js 
    for example:
        HTML
            <div class="color-box"
                 :class= "{active:  activeClass, 'text-danger': errorClass }">...</div> // General output will be class="color-box active"
                                                                                        // but not the errorClass

        JS 
            data: {
                activeClass: true,
                errorClass: false
            }

    We also can add classObject here
            <div class="classObject">...</div>

        JS
            data: {
                classObject:{
                    active: true,
                    'text-danger': false
                }
            }


    Style Binding:

        <div v-for:"variant in variants"
            :key="variant.variantId"
            :class="className"
            :style="{ background-color: variant.variantColor }"
            @mouseover="updateProductImage(variant.variantImage)">
        </div>


    We can also use an object that is to be binded to the style attribute

        index.html:
            <span :style="styleObject">..</span>

        main.js:
            data: {
                styleObject: {
                    color: 'red',
                    fontSize: '13px'
                }
            }

    from the above example you can see both the color and fontSize will be added to the span style as
        index.html:
            <span :style="color: red; font-size: 13px">...</span>

    we can have mutli-object,

        index.html:
            <span :style="[styleObject1, styleObject2]">..</span>
         main.js:
            data: {
                styleObject1: {
                    color: 'red',
                    fontSize: '13px'
                },
                styleObject2: {
                    color: 'red',
                    fontSize: '13px'
                }
            }



Computed Property:
    
    Computed is like a function that renders an output with the data object
    this is used where the results might be needed in many places

    These results are cached and so we dont need to rerun the code everytime we use
    This is the correct way to use than using a function.

    We can have it by using an computed object
    For example:

        JS  
            data : {
                brand: 'apple',
                product: 'phone'
            }
            computed: {
                title() {
                    return this.brand + ' ' + this.product
                }
            }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components:

    Components are reusable block code 
    
    Components can also have components within components 
    normally components are a block of code where a page code is split into component code
    this is used to maintain and have a clear understanding of what a particular place in webpage will
    do and what all will rendered and how it will work this are simply a HTML content that will be 
    sent to the DOM to be inserted


    To Create an Component 

            vue.component('product', {
                template:` 
                <div>
                ...
                </div>
                `,
                data() {
                    return {    <== Returns a fresh data object for each components
                        ...
                    }
                }
                    
            })


    What if we have a component within component and wish to share a data message to outscope
    But as the Scope is "this" is only compatible within the component we can use props 

PROPS a custom attribute for passing data into our components

        JS
            Vue.component('product',{
                props: [message],
                template: `<div>{{ message }}</div>`,
                data() { ... }
            })

        HTML    
            <product message="Hello !"></product>

    the above example is so simple and we simply get the value as message but
    we might also need the validations on the message.. to have them we can write as


        JS
            Vue.component('product', {
                props: {
                    message: {
                        type: String,
                        required: true,
                        default: "Hi"
                    }
                },
                template: `<div>...</div>`,
                data() { ... }
            })

THE ABOVE PROPS IS USED TO SEND THINGS INTO COMPONENTS 
        WHAT IF YOU NEED THINGS FROM COMPONENTS 


Communicating Event

    To get out a data from the component to parent we can use emitter which will emit signal to 
        parent saying something is changed or has happened.

    syntax for this is using        this.$emit('didSomething')

    Also here we have successfully emitted a signal but we haven't catched it in parent 
    to catch it in the parent we can use the event listener @ or v-on attributes

    For Example:
        HTML 
            <product :premium="premium" @add-to-cart="updateCart"></product>

        JS 
            Vue.component('product',{
                ...
                addToCart() {
                    this.$emit('add-to-cart') // to send an arg $emit('add-to-cart', id)
                }
            })


            var app = new Vue({
                ...
                data: {
                    ...
                    cart = 0
                },
                methods: {
                    updateCart()  {     // to get the id arg we give updatecart(id)
                        this.cart += 1
                    }
                }
            })
