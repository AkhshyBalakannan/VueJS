Vue CLI is command Line Interface

VueJs is an front-end framework which can be installed and which will make our works easy for us,
compile everything on our machine, not in a browser, live reload dev server
This VueJs will split the components and App.vue adn all the src and assest files will be pregenerated 

To create an VueJs CLI 

Pre-requested Node  
    to check the node   cmd -  node -v

    Install Vue CLI goto the github repo and copy the install cmd

        npm i -g vue-cli 
        // this will install cli globally in your machine

        To start using the cli we need to init using the cmd
            vue init <template name> <project name>

            example : vue init webpack my-project

    This will create an file where all the vue JS files and node modules files will be present 
    once we install we need to cd to the dir and give npm install to install all the dependencies in nodemodules

    After these steps we are ready to run the vueJs file using the cmd  

        npm run dev
            // this will run in local host in the browser


Files Tree :

in the files which we have created will give as set of files

    node_modules
    src
    index.html      // this is main or say as the root file from which browser loads to display
    .gitignore
    package.json
    webpack.config.js


    SRC File:
        this source folder is the second main folder where all our code lives and which will be sent to the index.html  
        for the rendering in the browser.

            Here we can see
                            assest
                            app.vue
                            main.js


In the main.js we can have all features of ES6 in the JavaScript such as import, short hand for functions and etc,.

Root Components for the project lives in the app.vue because we say 
        import App from './app.vue'
        render:h=>h(App)



        Basically a Vue file is simply a components file and it contains all the components code with template

            <template>
            </template>
            <script>
            export default {
                name: 'app', // name of the component when we have many this becomes handy
                data(){
                    return {
                        msg:"Hello world"
                    }
                }
            }
            </script>
            <style>
            </style>
